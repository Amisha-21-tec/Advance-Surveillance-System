# Advance-Surveillance-System
This AI-powered surveillance system boosts public safety by detecting weapons and accidents in real-time. It sends instant alerts to nearby police and hospitals via email, enabling quick response. A central website offers live/historical data access, and an interactive chatbot "Jini" handles authority queries efficiently.


Project Overview: Advanced Surveillance Integration of Weapon and Accident Detection

Main Objective:

The primary goal of this project is to enhance public safety through an AI-powered surveillance system capable of detecting weapons and accidents in real-time. Upon detection, the system instantly notifies the nearest police station and hospital via automated emails, enabling quicker response times and potentially saving lives. The platform also provides a centralized website for authorities to access live and historical data, along with an interactive chatbot named *Jini* for query handling.
